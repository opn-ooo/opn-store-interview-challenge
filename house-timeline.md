# House Timeline
There are 4 strangers living in the same house: **Bill, Elon, Mark, and Tim**. This house has 3 shared areas where they can live together: **Living Room, Kitchen, and Backyard**.

Due to COVID-19 situation they decided to track and keep house areas on the website to make it easier to see how often theyâ€™re facing each other.

The rules of this house are that each area gate will open for in/out only at 00 and 30 each hour, for example 00:00, 00:30, 15:30, etc.

## Requirement
- Create a web application using NodeJS or Javascript to store the records of areas usage (see [design](#design))
- Record will contain person name,room, and time period
- **Name** input is a dropdown containing `Bill, Elon, Mark, Tim` as values.,
- **Room** input is a dropdown containing `Living Room, Kitchen, Backyard` as values.
- **From** and **To** are dropdowns containing `00:00, 00:30, 01:00, â€¦, 23:30`
- Add form validation to ensure that each person can live at only 1 place at the same time
- Add a timeline calendar containing people and timeslot
- Draw record as a bar with color on timeline calendar. Color of each bar is depending on the area theyâ€™re living on
  - Living room => Blue
  - Kitchen => Yellow
  - Backyard => Green
- **BONUS POINT I:** Make it usable and look nice on mobile!!
- **BONUS POINT II:** Feel free to make it better than the given design ðŸ˜‰
